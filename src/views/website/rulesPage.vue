    </p>
    <h6>Random Sweepstakes Draws:</h6>
    <p>
      During the drawing, Company will use an automated random drawing process
      to draw a potential winner for the Promotion. One (1) entry (“Potential

      may include a background check to confirm the legal requirements for
      entrants as stated in these Official Rules. Entrants agree to subject
      themselves to a background check and shall provide the necessary
      information required. Pending a positive outcome of the background check,
      the potential winner will be required to execute both a Liability Release
      and Publicity Release that Company shall provide before awarding the
      Prize.
    </p>
    <h6>Prize:</h6>
    <p>
      Winner acknowledges that Promotion Entities have not made nor are in any
      manner responsible or liable for any warranty, representation, or
      guarantee, express or implied, in fact or in law, relative to the Prize.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prizes are not transferable or redeemable for cash and must be accepted as
      awarded, with no substitutions of any kind, except by the Sponsor, which
      reserves the right to substitute the Prize (or portion thereof) with one
      of comparable or greater value, at its sole discretion. All federal, state
      and local taxes, as well as any other costs and expenses associated with
      Prize acceptance and use not specified herein as being provided are the
      Winner’s responsibility. All Prize details are at the Sponsor’s sole
      discretion.
    </p>
    <h6>Winner Notification:</h6>
    <p>
      Potential Winner will be contacted through the email address that the
      Entrant used to enter the Promotion. If Prize is won by an eligible
      entrant who is at least 18 but still considered a minor in his/her state
      of residence, then prize may be awarded to his/her parent or legal
      guardian (who must execute and return all required documentation outlined
      herein and comply with all requirements imposed on Winner set forth
      herein). If the Potential Winner is found to be ineligible or not in
      compliance with these Official Rules, declines to accept the Prize, or
      Sponsor is unable to contact the Potential Winner within a reasonable
      period or in the event that the Prize notification is returned as
      undeliverable, the Prize will be forfeited and, at the Sponsor’s sole
      discretion, Prize may be awarded to an alternate Winner. Potential Winner
      (or parent/legal guardian if applicable) will be required to furnish proof
      of identification in a form satisfactory to Sponsor. Before being declared
      a Winner, the Potential Winner will be required to execute and return an
      Affidavit of Eligibility/Liability & Publicity Release (unless prohibited
      by law) and a W-9 form before the Prize is awarded, or the prize will be
      forfeited and, at Sponsor’s discretion, awarded to an alternate Winner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Promotion Entities shall not be held responsible for any delays in
      awarding the Prize for any reason beyond their control. Prize will be
      awarded to only a verified Winner as described in these Official Rules.
    </p>
    <p>
